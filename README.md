# Wine Reviews Analysis

The Wine Reviews data set I chose to work with was sourced from an external data source:

_Wine Reviews._ https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zynicide/wine-reviews. Accessed 2 Mar. 2024.

I chose to work with the data set because it fulfills the project brief requiurements outlined by Career Foundry. Additionally, I chose this data set because wine tasting has always been a bit of a hobby of mine, so I have personal interest in this particular type of data.

### Data Collection

The data set was acquired through web scraping methods. It was scraped from WineEnthusiast during the week of June 15th, 2017.

### Data Contents

The Wine Reviews data set consists of 150,930 rows and 10 columns (excluding the index column). It contains reviews of various wines with their area of origin, as well as price.

### Questions to Explore

* Where are the highest-rated wines located?
* What varieties of wine are consistently rated highest?
* Is there a relationship between the price of wine and a high rating?
* Is there a relationship between the location of wine and price?
* What countries produce the most wine?
* Are there specific provinces within those countries that produce higher-rated wines?
* What varieties of wine are produced most commonly?

_This storyboard does not contain every step taken as part of the analysis. Moreso, it was used to answer several of my 'Questions to Explore.'_

### Folders

The Wine Analysis folder consists of three sub-folders:
* Data Sets - Contains the raw and prepared data sets I worked with for this project
* Scripts - Contains the Python scripts I wrote to complete each required task for this project
  * _Note: within this folder is the script 'Sourcing and Analyzing Time Series Data' which works with a different data set from the Wine Reviews data set discussed here. This is due to the fact that the wine reviews data set does not contain a time series element. I picked a different data set to work with in order to fulfill the requirements outlined by Career Foundry for this particular section._
* Project Management - Contains the project brief provided by Career Foundry, and a PDF document which introduces the data set as well as the data profile, a table outlining the data consistency checks performed, and a table outlining my data wrangling steps.
