# Wine Reviews Analysis

The Wine Reviews data set I chose to work with was sourced from an external data source:

_Wine Reviews._ https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zynicide/wine-reviews. Accessed 2 Mar. 2024.

I chose to work with the data set because it fills the project brief requiurements outlined by Career Foundry. Additionally, I chose this data set because wine tasting has always been a bit of a hobby of mine, so I have personal interest in this particular type of data.

### Data Collection

The data set was acquired through web scraping methods. It was scraped from WineEnthusiast during the week of June 15th, 2017.

### Data Contents

The Wine Reviews data set consists of 150,930 rows and 10 columns (excluding the index column). It contains reviews of various wines with their area of origin, as well as price.

### Questions to Explore

* Where are the highest-rated wines located?
* What varieties of wine are consistently rated highest?
* Is there a relationship between the price of wine and a high rating?
* Is there a relationship between the location of wine and price?
* What countries produce the most wine?
* Are there specific provinces within those countries that produce higher-rated wines?
* What varieties of wine are produced most commonly?
